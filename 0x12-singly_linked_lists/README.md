# 0x12. C - Singly linked lists
This is an introduction to Data structures and how they're implemented and used in C programming language. This project focuses on the use and implementation of singly linked list.

* **[0-print_list.c](./0-print_list.c)** - Write a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.
    * Prototype: `size_t print_list(const list_t *h);`
    * Return: the number of nodes
    * Format: see example
    * If `str` is `NULL`, print `[0] (nil)`
    * You are allowed to use `printf`
