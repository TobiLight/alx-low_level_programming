# 0x14 .C - Bit manipulation
This project, **Bit manipulation**, focuses on a technique used to manipulare individual bits of a binary number or bit field. It involves performing bitwise operations such as AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, right shift and other operations.

* **[main.h](./main.h)** - Contains all the function prototypes, structs and typedefs for this project.
* **[test_case](/.test_case)** - Contains all the main.c functions used for testing purposes in this project only.
* **[0-binary_to_uint.c](./0-binary_to_uint.c)** - Write a function that converts a binary number to an `unsigned int`.
    * Prototype: `unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);`
    * where `b` is pointing to a string of `0` and `1` chars
    * Return: the converted number, or 0 if
        * there is one or more chars in the string `b` that is not `0` or `1`
        * `b` is `NULL`
